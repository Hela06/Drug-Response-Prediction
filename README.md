#DRUG RESPONSE PREDICTION
Predicting the clinical response of therapeutic agents is a major challenge in cancer treatment. 
Unfortunately, establishing accurate and robust methods in such a context is difficult. 
Most approaches exploit only clinical data and gene expression information without considering other resources, such as pathways, capable of shedding light on the comprehension of such phenomena. 
We present a new method for drug response prediction which exploits pathway alteration information retrieved by PHENSIM.
